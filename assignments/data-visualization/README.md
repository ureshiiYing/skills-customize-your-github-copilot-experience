# 📘 Assignment: Python Data Visualization

## 🎯 Objective

Learn to create and customize charts and graphs in Python using matplotlib or plotly. Practice visualizing data to gain insights and communicate findings effectively.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️  Load and Explore Data

#### Description
Load a sample dataset (CSV or built-in) and perform basic exploration to understand its structure and contents.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Load a dataset using pandas
- Display the first 5 rows of the data
- Show summary statistics (mean, min, max, etc.)

#### Description
Use matplotlib or plotly to create at least two different types of charts (e.g., bar chart, line graph, scatter plot) to visualize aspects of the data.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Generate at least two different chart types
- Label axes and add a title to each chart
- Save each chart as an image file (e.g., PNG)

Example output:
```text
Bar chart saved as bar_chart.png
Line graph saved as line_graph.png
```

### 🛠️  (Optional) Customize and Interpret

#### Description
Enhance your charts with custom colors, legends, or annotations. Write a short summary interpreting one of your visualizations.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Apply at least one customization (color, legend, etc.)
